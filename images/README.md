Place a photo for Week 3 here.

- Recommended filename: `week03.jpg`
- Place the file at `images/week03.jpg` at the repository root.

Usage in `makes/week03.md` (already added):

![Week 3 photo](/images/week03.jpg)

Alternatives:
- Use a remote URL instead of a local file: `![Week 3 photo](https://example.com/photo.jpg)`
- If your site generator uses different static paths, adjust the image path accordingly.

If you want, tell me the image filename and I will update the link in `makes/week03.md` to match it.
